## Guidelines
Each section in the configuration file represents a strategy for calculating the influence score and influence category. In the section, the name of the first variable is the description of the function for calculating the influence score, and the value of the same variable is the name of the function in the Python code. The names of the other variables, except for the last one, represent the path to the input files (in feather format), and the last one represents the path of the output file created by calculating the influence score.
